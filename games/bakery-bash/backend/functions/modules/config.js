// Balance pass 1 (Apr 2026): demand pool was 305 customers/round across all 6
// products — too small to support any per-customer revenue. Operating costs
// (sous chefs, specialty chef bids) dwarfed product revenue, so every engaged
// strategy lost money in tournament probes. Bumped baseDemand 4–6× so product
// sales become the dominant income source.
//
// Balance pass 2: rebalanced nationality strengths so no nationality is
// structurally dominant.
//
// Balance pass 6: rebalanced premium prices and demand. After pass 5,
// premium-only menus still won 94% because sandwich at $8.75 alone earned
// 3.5× per customer vs cookie at $2.50, and even when premium products
// had lower demand, satisfaction-weighted competitive split favored the
// menu with smaller demand pools (easier to saturate → higher sat).
// New approach: lower premium prices to bring per-customer revenue in
// line with cheap products (premium ≈ 1.6× cheap, not 3.5×); demand
// uniform across all products (sandwich/matcha 200, others 200–240).
// Price-zone updates below match the new fixedPrice so players who don't
// submit a price still pay the catalog default at competitive mid.
//
// Per-product max revenue (baseDemand × fixedPrice):
//   coffee:    240 × $4.00 = $960
//   croissant: 240 × $4.75 = $1,140
//   bagel:     220 × $3.00 = $660
//   cookie:    200 × $2.50 = $500
//   sandwich:  200 × $5.50 = $1,100
//   matcha:    200 × $4.50 = $900
// Range: $500–$1,140, premium tier no longer 2× cheap. Cookie still
// lowest revenue ceiling but compensates via lowest stock cost and
// largest customer share at floor pricing.
// Balance pass 8: satisfactionWeight equalized to 1.0 for all products.
// Previously coffee's weight 1.2 (higher than others) gave any team
// offering coffee a small aggregate-satisfaction boost — and that
// disproportionately benefited French (croissant + coffee) and Italian
// (sandwich + coffee) over Japanese and American. With equal weights,
// aggregate sat just averages across offered products fairly.
//
// Balance pass 9: bumped bagel and cookie demand from 220/200 → 240/240
// so American's specialty pair (bagel + cookie = 480) matches French's
// (croissant + coffee = 480) in raw demand.
//
// Balance pass 10: also bumped bagel/cookie default prices to close the
// per-customer revenue gap. Nationality specialty per-customer revenue:
//   French   (croissant $4.75 + coffee $4.00):   $8.75
//   Japanese (matcha $4.50 + croissant $4.75):   $9.25
//   Italian  (sandwich $5.50 + coffee $4.00):    $9.50
//   American (bagel $3.75 + cookie $3.25):       $7.00
// Range: $7.00–$9.50, ~35% spread. American is still cheapest tier
// (thematic constraint: bagel/cookie are inherently low-priced grab-and-
// go items), but they now sit at higher demand (240 each) which gives
// American competitive customer count to offset the per-customer gap.
// Combined nationality-specialty round revenue ceiling (demand × price):
//   French:   240 × $4.75 + 240 × $4.00 = $1,140 + $960  = $2,100
//   Japanese: 200 × $4.50 + 240 × $4.75 = $900   + $1,140 = $2,040
//   Italian:  200 × $5.50 + 240 × $4.00 = $1,100 + $960   = $2,060
//   American: 240 × $3.75 + 240 × $3.25 = $900   + $780   = $1,680
// Range: $1,680–$2,100, ~25% spread. Acceptable given American's
// cheap-product theme; narrows from the original 60%+ imbalance.
