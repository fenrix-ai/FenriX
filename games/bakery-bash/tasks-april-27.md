# Tasks April 27 — Pre-Playtest Triage

**Date:** 2026-04-27 (eve of Apr 28 playtest)
**Branch tested:** `fix/multi-day-returning-customers-30x` @ `d630a75` (+ uncommitted fixes for P0-1 and P1-2/3/4)
**Scope:** All PRs merged today (#107–#118) plus the in-progress multi-day fix
**Method:** Firebase emulator (auth+firestore+functions) + 17 integration scripts + 3 unit test files + custom mixed-team end-to-end script (1 / 2 / 3-person teams across 2 rounds) + 70-player scale stress test
**Bottom line:** Both P0 blockers fixed and verified in the working tree. (1) Snapshot/restore csvRows loss — fixed via `dumpCollection.listDocuments()`. (2) Concurrent-join + concurrent-submit contention — fixed by moving shared-doc atomic increments outside the transactions in joinGame / createTeam / submitDecision. Stress test now: **70/70 joins** (was 20/70), **70/70 concurrent submitDecisions in 735 ms** (was 22 s + 60 aborts). Ready to commit and ship.

> **Status of fixes (as of 2026-04-27 22:35):**
> - ✅ **P0-1 fixed in working tree** — `dumpCollection` now uses `listDocuments()`; `walkDocs` traverses ghost parents; `scripts/test-snapshot-csvrows.js` regression test added and **passing**. Original `test-snapshot-restore.js` still **passing**.
> - ✅ **P0-2 FIXED in working tree** — split `joinGame` and `createTeam` into per-uid txns + post-txn atomic increments; removed vestigial `gameRef.update({ updatedAt })` from `submitDecision`; moved team-pending mirror outside the txn; skipped team-doc reads for solo/finance roles. **70-player join: 4s (was 19s, no contention errors). 70-player concurrent submitDecision: 700ms (was 22s+ with 50+ aborts).**
> - ✅ Bonus fix: added `playerCap` pass-through to `mergeConfig` and a `playerCap: 20` default in `DEFAULT_GAME_CONFIG` — the per-game config override was being silently dropped, capping every game at 20 regardless of what the prof set.
> - ✅ P1-2 partially fixed (one remaining edge: "Late Joiner" rejoin path, see below).
> - ✅ P1-3 fixed (PROJECT_ID corrected; this is what surfaced P0-2).
> - ✅ P1-4 fixed (3 of 4 boundary-bid soft-fails resolved; XSS test still fails per P2-3 — benign).
> - ✅ Bonus fix: corrected `test-70-players.js` decision generator (it disabled the `cookie` base product, which the validator rejects, and used non-existent `latte` / `matchaLatte` keys instead of `coffee` / `matcha`).

## TL;DR

| Severity | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ P0 — was blocking, now fixed | 2 | (a) Snapshot/restore csvRows loss — fixed by `dumpCollection.listDocuments()`. (b) 70-player join + submit contention — fixed by moving shared-doc atomic increments outside the transaction in joinGame / createTeam / submitDecision. |
| 🟡 P1 — fix this week | 3 | Cold-start submit latency (~4s); test drift on submit-decision-flow / edge-cases / 70-players (PROJECT_ID — landed). |
| 🟢 P2 — nice-to-have | 4 | Trigger-aggregation latency (~3s p99 in emu), test wait timings, harmless XSS test, minor false alarms. |
| ✅ Passing | 18 test files | Listed at bottom (+1 new: `test-snapshot-csvrows.js`). |

## 🔴 P0 — Fix before tomorrow's playtest

### P0-1. `restoreSnapshot` silently loses every csvRow

**Where:** [`games/bakery-bash/backend/functions/modules/snapshot.js:150-157`](games/bakery-bash/backend/functions/modules/snapshot.js)

**What:**
`dumpCollection` walks subcollections via `collRef.get()`, which only returns documents that have data. `csvRows/{playerId}` is a "ghost parent" — the FE writer only ever creates `csvRows/{playerId}/rounds/{roundId}` (see [`functions/index.js:2316-2326`](games/bakery-bash/backend/functions/index.js)) and never materialises the parent doc. As a result:

1. `dumpCollection(csvRowsRef)` returns **empty** → snapshot stores no csvRows.
2. The restore "clean" pass deletes all live `csvRows/{playerId}/rounds/{roundId}` docs because they aren't in the snapshot path set.
3. After a single Save → Restart round, **`exportProfessorCsv` throws `failed-precondition: No round data available yet`** for completed rounds.

**Repro (verified just now in the emulator):**
```
csvRows/player_a/rounds/round_1.exists: true   (before snapshot)
csvRows/player_a.exists:                false  (ghost parent)
   → createSnapshot:    totalDocs=3            (csvRow doc NOT in dump)
   → restoreSnapshot:   3 written, 0 deleted
csvRows/player_a/rounds/round_1.exists: false  (gone — bug confirmed)
```

This was hidden because [`scripts/test-snapshot-restore.js`](games/bakery-bash/backend/scripts/test-snapshot-restore.js) doesn't seed any csvRows-shaped paths.

**Why this matters tomorrow:** The whole point of T2.4 is "Save / Restart this round" as a panic button. If a professor uses it after a round has already simulated, they lose every CSV they were going to hand to students.

**Proposed fix** (10 lines, smallest blast radius):

Change `dumpCollection` in [`snapshot.js:150-157`](games/bakery-bash/backend/functions/modules/snapshot.js) to combine `.listDocuments()` (returns ghost-parent refs) with `.get()` (gets the data). Walk every ref, but only persist `data` when the snap exists:

```js
async function dumpCollection(collRef, opts) {
  const refs = await collRef.listDocuments();   // includes ghost parents
  const docs = [];
  for (const ref of refs) {
    docs.push(await dumpDoc(ref, opts));        // dumpDoc already handles !exists
  }
  return docs;
}
```

`dumpDoc` already guards with `data: snap.exists ? serialize(snap.data()) : null` so ghost parents round-trip as `{exists: false, subcollections: {...}}`. The restore writer (line 380-ish) skips `data` when `!exists`, so we just write the leaf rounds back.

**Validation:** rerun `scripts/test-snapshot-restore.js` (still passes), plus the repro script above (now passes), plus the new e2e (csvRows survive across snapshot+advance+restore).

---

### P0-2. `joinGame` transaction-abort cascade at 70 concurrent joiners

**Where:** [`games/bakery-bash/backend/functions/index.js:1069-1198`](games/bakery-bash/backend/functions/index.js) — the `db.runTransaction` block in `joinGame`. Specifically the `transaction.update(gameRef, { totalPlayers: FieldValue.increment(1), ... })` at line 1198 and the parallel team-doc update at line 1184.

**What (measured just now in the emulator):**
With `PLAYER_COUNT = 70` running `joinGame` via `Promise.allSettled`:
```
Joins attempted:           70
Joins succeeded:           20  (28%)
Joins failed (INTERNAL):   50  (72%)
```

joinGame timing distribution (from the functions emulator log, n=71 invocations including a pre-warm):

| Percentile | Latency |
|---|---|
| min   | 6 ms (warmup) |
| median | 23.07 s |
| p90   | 25.84 s |
| p99   | 28.69 s |
| avg   | 18.16 s |

The functions emulator log shows the underlying error:

```
"Unhandled error Error: 10 ABORTED: Transaction lock timeout."
   at /firestore_client.js:242:33
```

This is Firestore's per-document write lock. Every joinGame transaction reads + writes the **same** game doc (`totalPlayers: FieldValue.increment(1)`) and the **same** team doc (`memberCount: FieldValue.increment(1)`) for whichever team the player picked. With 70 concurrent transactions on those two hot docs, lock contention pushes most beyond Firestore's transaction lock timeout (~30 s) and they exhaust their retry budget.

**Why this matters tomorrow:** Whatever the prof says ("everyone hit join now"), 50/70 of the class lands on a red `INTERNAL` error toast and has to retry. Even the 20 that succeed wait 23 s each — a UX cliff on the very first action.

**Why PR #98 didn't catch this:** PR #98 sharded the **submission** and **bid** writes (the original 70-player auction collapse). joinGame's totalPlayers + memberCount writes were not part of that fix because joins are typically a once-per-session event. They are now visibly the next contention point.

**Why earlier 70-player runs reported `not-found` instead:** the existing `scripts/test-70-players.js` uses `PROJECT_ID = "demo-bakery-bash-54d12"` while the emulator runs as `bakery-bash-54d12` (single-project mode). The admin client wrote the game to one project and the functions runtime queried another, hiding this contention behind a project-mismatch error. After fixing PROJECT_ID and pre-warming all 26 callables, the real failure mode surfaces.

**Fix landed (2026-04-27 22:35) — none of the originally proposed alternatives needed.**

The root cause was a hybrid of two contention patterns inside the transaction body:
1. **joinGame / createTeam**: `transaction.update(gameRef, { totalPlayers: FieldValue.increment(1) })` and the analogous team-doc write were 70-way / ~9-way concurrent writes inside a transaction, hitting Firestore's pessimistic write lock.
2. **submitDecision**: a vestigial `transaction.update(gameRef, { updatedAt })` re-introduced 70-way contention that the T3.3 sharding (PR #103) was designed to eliminate, plus per-team contention on the team `state/pending` mirror doc and the team-doc `roleAssignments` reads.

**Applied fix — same surgical pattern in both callables:**

1. Keep the **per-uid** writes (player + roster + decision docs) inside the transaction so atomicity holds for the caller's own state.
2. Move the **shared-doc atomic counter writes** (`game.totalPlayers`, `team.memberCount`, `team.roleAssignments.${uid}`, the team-pending decisionDraft mirror) **outside** the transaction. `set({ merge: true })` and `update({ field: FieldValue.increment(1) })` outside a transaction don't take pessimistic write locks — they serialize at the doc-level via Firestore's atomic counter, which scales to many more concurrent writers.
3. **Skip the team-doc + team-pending-doc reads inside `submitDecision` when the caller's role is `solo` or `finance`** — both bypass the price-gate, so the reads are pure overhead and add ~9-way read-lock contention per round.
4. Removed the vestigial `transaction.update(gameRef, { updatedAt })` from `submitDecision`.
5. **Bonus fix:** `mergeConfig` was silently dropping the `playerCap` config field, so every game was capped at the hardcoded fallback of 20 regardless of what the prof set. Added `playerCap: 20` to `DEFAULT_GAME_CONFIG` and a pass-through line in `mergeConfig` so per-game overrides actually take effect.

**Cap-check correctness note:** with the increment moved post-txn, `gSnap.get('totalPlayers')` lags by the number of in-flight joins. For a 20-cap with 25 concurrent joiners, up to 5 may slip past the cap. Acceptable for a class with cap >> realistic attendance; tighten with a sharded counter (PR #103 pattern) if exact enforcement is ever needed.

**Files touched:**
- `functions/index.js` — `joinGame`, `createTeam`, `submitDecision` (per the four points above).
- `functions/modules/config.js` — `DEFAULT_GAME_CONFIG.playerCap = 20`, plus pass-through in `mergeConfig`.
- `scripts/test-70-players.js` — added `playerCap: PLAYER_COUNT + 10` to the seeded config; corrected the malformed menu generator that disabled the `cookie` base product and used non-existent `latte` / `matchaLatte` keys instead of `coffee` / `matcha`; added failure-breakdown logging.

**Original fallback options (kept here for reference, NOT needed):**
- ~~Stagger joins UI-side with jitter (`await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, Math.random() * 4000))`)~~ — would have helped at the lobby but the backend fix solves the underlying contention without depending on FE behavior.
- ~~Shard `totalPlayers` like PR #103 did for `submittedCount`~~ — heavier change than needed; the simpler "increment outside txn" fix is enough because `totalPlayers` doesn't have hot-spot writes the way per-round submit counts do.
- ~~Verbal "team 1 join, count to five, team 2 join" cadence~~ — no longer required.

**Caveat:** the emulator's transaction concurrency is intentionally throttled. Production Cloud Firestore handles per-doc writes with hot-spot mitigation that the local jar doesn't replicate, so the **real** abort rate may be lower than 72%. But 23 s median is the latency the emulator reports inside the function, not network round-trip — that one will translate to production. Even with optimistic Firestore, 70 increments to one doc within 1 second will burn the per-doc write quota and queue.

## 🟡 P1 — Fix this week

### P1-1. Cold-start latency on first `submitDecision` after deploy ≈ 4 s

**Where:** Functions runtime startup (no single source line).

**Measured:**
- First submit after a full restart: **4028 ms** (one student)
- Subsequent submits (warm): **150-315 ms**

**Why:** The pre-warm flow (PR #102) hits each callable with `_warmup: true` so the runtime instantiates them, but Cloud Functions Gen 2 cold-starts a *new* instance whenever an old one ages out or a real submit lands on an unwarmed instance. With 70 students, a synchronised submit storm can race a warm-up.

**Mitigation already in place:** Pre-warm button (PR #102/#118), HEAVY_CALLABLE_OPTS `timeoutSeconds: 120` (PR #116).

**Proposed fix:** Have the professor's "Warm up servers" press a button **2 minutes** before class (the practice run runbook in PR #109 should call this out). If that's already documented, this becomes a P2.

### P1-2. `test-submit-decision-flow.js` — outdated `joinGame` error-code expectation **(partial fix landed)**

**Where:** [`scripts/test-submit-decision-flow.js:222-225`](games/bakery-bash/backend/scripts/test-submit-decision-flow.js)

**Original symptom:**
```
FAIL: non-existent join code — expected code "not-found",
      got "functions/invalid-argument": Provide either teamNumber (1–8) or teamId.
```

**Cause:** `joinGame` was tightened to require `teamNumber` or `teamId` (BE-R01/R02). The test still called `joinGame({ joinCode: "ZZZZZZ", displayName: "Valid Name" })` without a team ref, so it failed the new arg validation before the join-code lookup.

**Fix applied:** added `teamNumber: 1` to the two `expectError` calls at lines 222-225 and 230-233. ✓

**Remaining issue (new symptom after the fix):**
```
FAIL: game not in lobby — expected "failed-precondition" but call succeeded.
```
The "Late Joiner" expectation uses the same `joinGame1` callable (same uid as Test Player 1, who joined earlier in the test). joinGame's rejoin path lets an existing player rejoin at any phase regardless of the lobby gate (line 1088-1091 in `index.js`), so the call succeeds instead of failing.

**Proposed follow-up fix:** sign in a third anonymous user and pass *that* `getFunctions(app3)` to the late-join `expectError`, so the player doc doesn't already exist on the game. ~5 lines.

### P1-3. `test-70-players.js` — wrong `PROJECT_ID`

**Where:** [`scripts/test-70-players.js:20`](games/bakery-bash/backend/scripts/test-70-players.js)

**Symptom (first run, before fix):**
```
First 3 join errors: not-found, not-found, not-found
💥 FATAL ERROR: 70 joins failed
```

**Cause:** The test uses `PROJECT_ID = "demo-bakery-bash-54d12"` but the running emulator is `bakery-bash-54d12` (single-project mode, see the `firebase` process command line). The admin client writes to a different project than the functions emulator's admin SDK reads.

**Proposed fix:**
```diff
-const PROJECT_ID = "demo-bakery-bash-54d12";
+const PROJECT_ID = "bakery-bash-54d12";
```

**After applying this fix and re-running with all 26 callables warm:** the test surfaced **P0-2 above** (50/70 INTERNAL aborts at the joinGame stage). So fixing this test is the prerequisite for catching the join-contention bug that P0-2 documents — and we should keep the fixed version as the standing scale regression test.

### P1-4. `test-edge-cases-adversarial.js` — wrong submitBids payload shape

**Where:** [`scripts/test-edge-cases-adversarial.js:135-145`](games/bakery-bash/backend/scripts/test-edge-cases-adversarial.js)

**Symptom:** 4 "soft failures" — `$0`/`$1`/huge bids reported as "REJECTED but should accept".

**Cause:** Test passes `{bidType:"ad", bids: {TV: 0}}`. The validator (`validateAdBids` in `decision-validation.js:212-240`) accepts either `data.adBids` or top-level keys, but `bids` is neither — it falls through to the unknown-keys check and rejects with `Unknown ad type in bids: "bids"`. The runtime is correct; the test is wrong.

**Proposed fix:**
```diff
-await submitBids({ gameId: g3, bidType: "ad", bids: t.payload });
+await submitBids({ gameId: g3, bidType: "ad", adBids: t.payload });
```

Same change at line 184 for `chefBids: []`.

---

## 🟢 P2 — Nice to have

### P2-1. Sharded-counter aggregation lag (130 ms - 3 s p99 on emulator)

**Measured:** First post-warm submit → trigger fires in ~600 ms; p99 closer to 3 s on the local emulator.

**FE impact:** SubmissionLock briefly shows "X / N submitted" lagging 1-3 s behind reality. Not a deal-breaker — it's eventually consistent and the UX is the same as before sharding.

**Why it's not P1:** Production Cloud Functions have sub-second trigger latency; the emulator is just slow. Real risk is small.

**If we want to fix:** Stop relying on the public aggregated `submissions/{docId}` doc on the fast path. The shard set is already authoritative — read shards directly in the FE for "is this uid done?" queries (count is fine to stay aggregated).

### P2-2. `test-cross-feature.js` and `test-sharded-counter.js` — flaky

These both fail intermittently because they `setTimeout(r, 1500)` then read the aggregated submission count. Trigger latency >1.5 s = false fail. The production code is correct (verified by polling); the tests need a longer wait or a poll loop.

**Proposed fix:** Replace fixed waits with `await waitFor(() => ..., 10_000)` polling.

### P2-3. XSS-shaped team names accepted (no real impact)

**Where:** Edge-cases test flagged `<script>alert('xss')</script>` accepted as a team name.

**Why no impact:** No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` exists in the React FE (`grep -rn "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" app/src/` → 0 hits). React escapes `{teamName}` in JSX automatically. So even though the backend stores the raw string, the FE renders it as plain text. CSV export (`buildCsvString`) wraps cell values in quotes, so it's safe there too.

**If we want a defensive fix:** strip `<` and `>` in `cleanString` for team-name-shaped fields, or whitelist `[A-Za-z0-9 _'-]` for team names.

### P2-4. `test-sharded-counter.js` 25-player concurrent submit — 24 / 25 timeouts

**Where:** [`scripts/test-sharded-counter.js`](games/bakery-bash/backend/scripts/test-sharded-counter.js)

**Symptom:** With 25 anonymous Auth users hitting `submitDecision` concurrently, **only 1** call succeeds (in 70 s) and 24 hit `deadline-exceeded`. Locally only — the emulator's transaction concurrency is the bottleneck, not the production runtime.

**Why it's P2:** Production Firestore can sustain hundreds of concurrent transactions on different docs. The emulator throttles at ~1-2 transactions/sec/doc. The actual submitDecision design (per-uid shard, per-team pending doc, per-uid player doc) has zero shared write contention. Will retest when we have a real Cloud Functions deploy.

**If we want a quick local fix:** stagger the test's concurrent submits over ~3 s (`await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 100 + i*50))`) instead of `Promise.allSettled` everything at once.

## Recommendation for tomorrow

**Critical (must do before class):**
1. ✅ **P0-1 done.** Snapshot now uses `listDocuments()` and round-trips ghost-parent docs. Verified by `test-snapshot-csvrows.js` (new regression test) and the existing `test-snapshot-restore.js`. Commit and ship.
2. ✅ **P0-2 done.** Backend now handles 70/70 concurrent joins (was 20/70) and 70/70 concurrent submitDecisions in 735ms total (was 22+ s with 60 failures). All applied to `functions/index.js` + `functions/modules/config.js` + `scripts/test-70-players.js`. Commit and ship.

**Operational mitigation if neither P0-2 fix lands in time:**
- Tell the prof to introduce a 5-second cadence: "team 1 join, count to five, team 2 join…" Verbal stagger does the same job as the FE jitter.
- Pre-warm button ~2 minutes before class (already documented in `PRACTICE_RUN_RUNBOOK.md`).

**Optional but cheap:** the four P1 test fixes above are all 1-2 line edits. Worth landing so we're not re-investigating known-stale assertions next time. The PROJECT_ID fix in particular (P1-3) should land — without it, our standing scale regression test silently fails before exercising any backend code.

**Skip for now:** P2-4 (25-concurrent-submit emulator timeouts) — production has >>100x the per-doc throughput cap of the local jar, and the writes are already sharded post-PR-#103.

If P0-1 + P0-2 land and the snapshot-restore + 70-player + e2e runs all go green, this is good to merge.

## On the open PR / admin merge question

Currently on `fix/multi-day-returning-customers-30x` @ `d630a75`. The branch has the `returningCustomersPending` 30× scaling fix (passes new unit test, no other test regressions). It is **not yet on origin as a PR** — `gh pr list` returned `[]`. Two options:

- **A. Merge the multi-day fix first, then ship P0-1 in a follow-up.** Cleaner per-fix history. Recommend this.
- **B. Stack P0-1 on top of the multi-day branch.** Faster to one PR, but ties unrelated changes together.

I have **not** auto-merged anything — the snapshot bug is concerning enough that I want a human to look at the proposed `dumpCollection` fix before it goes out (the admin-merge bypasses CI, and that's a load-bearing change).

---

## Files to look at first if you want to verify

- The repro: I deleted my temp scripts after running them, but the bug is reproducible in 30 lines — happy to write them back into `scripts/test-snapshot-csvrows.js` if useful.
- The fix target: [`games/bakery-bash/backend/functions/modules/snapshot.js:150-157`](games/bakery-bash/backend/functions/modules/snapshot.js).
- The CSV writer that creates the ghost parent: [`games/bakery-bash/backend/functions/index.js:2316-2326`](games/bakery-bash/backend/functions/index.js).
