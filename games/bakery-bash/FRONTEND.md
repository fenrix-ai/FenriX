## Open Questions

1. **Minigame spec:** What exactly is the Phase 3 minigame? Needs a decision before April 4.
2. **Mobile support:** Desktop-only or do students play on phones?
3. **Auction UX:** Can a player bid on multiple ad types or just one?
4. **Budget display:** Real-time deductions as inputs change, or only shown on submit?
