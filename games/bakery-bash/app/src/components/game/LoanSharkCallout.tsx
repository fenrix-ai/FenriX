 * FE-12 — Red banner shown on the results screen when the player had to
 * borrow from the loan shark this round.
 *
 * Backend data: `players/{uid}.lastRoundResult.amountBorrowed` +
 * `interestCharged` (written by simulation). Per
 * GAME_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md the interest rate is 10% — we display the
 * actual `interestCharged` amount rather than recomputing, so any rate
 * change on the backend flows through without an FE release.
 *
 * Empty state: component returns `null` when `amountBorrowed` is 0 or
 * missing, so results pages can safely always render it.
